This is a simple and interactive quiz website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, navigate through the quiz using "Next" and "Previous" buttons, and view their score at the end. The quiz also includes a timer feature, which displays a message when the time runs out. This project is a great example of using basic web technologies to create an engaging and responsive user experience.
